### Please generate a valid TensorFlow model with public TensorFlow APIs. When converted to TensorFlow Lite model, the model should be able to trigger the optimization pass `FuseFullyConnectedAndMul`. Additionally, please generate valid input tensors for the model and pass to the model.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
filter = tf.Variable([...]) # a constant tensor
cst = tf.Variable([...]) # a constant tensor, shape = [1, 1, ..., 1, last_dim]
y = tf.matmul(input_tensor, filter) * cst # Mul is applied on the output of FullyConnectedOp
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a FullyConnectedOp is invoked on a tensor and a constant filter input, and then a Mul operation is invoked on the output tensor and a constant tensor. The FullyConnected operation should have the following properties:
   - The filter input should be a constant tensor.
   - The bias input should either be of NoneType or a constant tensor.
   - The fused activation function should be "NONE".
The constant tensor from the Mul operation should have all dimensions equal to 1, except for the last dimension. The constant tensor from the Mul operation should be broadcastable with the filter tensor of the FullyConnected operation after reshaping and transposing the constant tensor.


# Model
```python
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()
    self.w1 = tf.Variable([[3., 4.], [5., 6.]])
    self.m1 = tf.Variable([7., 8.])

  def call(self, x1):
    return tf.matmul(x1, self.w1) * self.m1

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [1, 2]
x1 = tf.constant([1., 2.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y1 = m(x1)
```

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
filter = tf.Variable([...]) # a constant tensor
rhs = tf.Variable([...]) # a constant tensor, shape = [last_dim]
input_tensor = tf.Variable([...]) # a tensor
y = tf.matmul(input_tensor * rhs, filter) # Mul is applied on the input of FullyConnectedOp
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a Mul operation is invoked on an input tensor and a constant tensor, and then a FullyConnectedOp is invoked on the output tensor and a constant filter input. The Mul operation should have the following properties:
   - The rhs input should be a constant tensor with a 1D shape.
   - The fused activation function should be "NONE".
The FullyConnected operation should have the following properties:
   - The weights format should be "DEFAULT".
   - The filter input should be a constant tensor.
Both the rhs tensor from the Mul operation and the filter tensor from the FullyConnected operation should be of F32 type.
