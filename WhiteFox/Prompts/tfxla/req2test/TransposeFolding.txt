### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `TransposeFolding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following patterns:

1. A dot operation where one or both of its operands are non-identity transpose operations. A non-identity transpose operation is one where the transpose changes the order of the dimensions. For example:

```python
t1 = tf.transpose(input_tensor1, perm=[1, 0])
t2 = tf.transpose(input_tensor2, perm=[1, 0])
dot_product = tf.tensordot(t1, t2, axes=1)
```

2. A convolution operation where one or both of its operands are transpose operations. For example:

```python
t1 = tf.transpose(input_tensor1, perm=[1, 0, 2, 3])
t2 = tf.transpose(input_tensor2, perm=[1, 0, 2, 3])
conv = tf.nn.conv2d(t1, t2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')
```

In both cases, the `TransposeFolding` optimization pass will attempt to fold the transpose operations into the dot or convolution operations, effectively removing the transpose operations and adjusting the dot or convolution operations to achieve the same result. This can lead to performance improvements by reducing the number of operations in the model.
