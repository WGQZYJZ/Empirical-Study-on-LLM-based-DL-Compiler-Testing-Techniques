### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `AllReduceCombiner` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain multiple AllReduce operations that can be combined into a single AllReduce operation. The characteristics of these AllReduce operations should be:

1. All the AllReduce operations should be in the same computation.
2. All the AllReduce operations should have exactly one operand.
3. All the AllReduce operations should have the same reduction operation.
4. The operands of the AllReduce operations should be arrays.
5. The total size of the operands of the AllReduce operations should exceed the threshold set by `combine_threshold_in_bytes_` and `combine_threshold_count_`.

The pattern in the model could be something like this:

```python
t1 = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor1)
t2 = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensor2)
...
tn = tf.reduce_sum(input_tensorn)
```

Where `input_tensor1`, `input_tensor2`, ..., `input_tensorn` are the operands of the AllReduce operations. The total size of these operands should exceed the threshold for the `AllReduceCombiner` optimization to be triggered.
