### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `WhileLoopConstantSinking` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain a while loop where the initial value of the loop is a tuple. The optimization pass `WhileLoopConstantSinking` is triggered when there are constants or broadcasts of constants in the tuple that are invariant across the loop iterations. 

In other words, the model should have a pattern like this:

```python
def condition(*args):
    # condition code
    return tf.reduce_any(args[0] < 10)

def body(*args):
    # body code
    return tf.add(args[0], 1), args[1]

# args[1] is a constant or a broadcast of a constant
result = tf.while_loop(condition, body, [tf.constant(0), tf.constant(2)])
```

In this pattern, `args[1]` is a constant or a broadcast of a constant that does not change across loop iterations. The `WhileLoopConstantSinking` optimization pass will be triggered for such a model, and it will try to sink these constants into the while loop body and condition.
