### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `TopkRewriter` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain a `tf.sort` operation that is used in a Top-K context. The characteristics of the model that trigger the `TopkRewriter` optimization pass are as follows:

1. The model contains a `tf.sort` operation with one or two operands. If there are two operands, the second one must be an `Iota` operation or a broadcasted `Iota` operation.

2. The comparison function used in the `tf.sort` operation must be a NaN-safe greater-than operation. This means that the comparison function should be able to handle NaN values correctly.

3. The `tf.sort` operation is used in a Top-K context. This means that the output of the `tf.sort` operation is sliced to get the top K elements. The slicing operation must start at the beginning of the tensor and must not have any strides. If the input to the `tf.sort` operation has a batch dimension, slicing along the batch dimension is not supported.

4. The input to the `tf.sort` operation must be a 1D or 2D tensor of type `F32` or `BF16`.

5. The `TopkRewriter` optimization pass also includes a profitability check. This check determines whether it is beneficial to convert the `tf.sort` operation to a custom Top-K operation. The details of this check are not provided in the function code.

Here is an example of a TensorFlow model that would trigger the `TopkRewriter` optimization pass:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create a 2D tensor
input_tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 3.0, 2.0], [4.0, 6.0, 5.0]])

# Sort the tensor along the last dimension
sorted_tensor = tf.sort(input_tensor, axis=-1, direction='DESCENDING')

# Get the top 2 elements
top_k_tensor = tf.slice(sorted_tensor, [0, 0], [-1, 2])
```

In this example, the `tf.sort` operation is used in a Top-2 context. The output of the `tf.sort` operation is sliced to get the top 2 elements. The input to the `tf.sort` operation is a 2D tensor of type `F32`. Therefore, the `TopkRewriter` optimization pass would be triggered for this model.
