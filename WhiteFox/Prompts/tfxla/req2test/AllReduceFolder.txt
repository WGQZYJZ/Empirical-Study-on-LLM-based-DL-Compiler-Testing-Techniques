### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `AllReduceFolder` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.all_reduce(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.all_reduce(t1, ...)
```
The pattern describes that there are two all-reduce operators in the model. The first `all_reduce` operator performs an all-reduce operation on a tensor input `input_tensor`, and the second `all_reduce` operator performs an all-reduce operation on the output of the first `all_reduce`.

The two all-reduce operations must be compatible, except for the replica groups. Both all-reduce operations must have non-empty replica groups. The replica groups of the two all-reduce operations should be able to be folded into a single set. If the replica groups cannot be folded, the optimization will not be triggered.

The optimization will also not be triggered if the first all-reduce operation has more than one user, or if the module contains all-reduce with constrained layouts.
