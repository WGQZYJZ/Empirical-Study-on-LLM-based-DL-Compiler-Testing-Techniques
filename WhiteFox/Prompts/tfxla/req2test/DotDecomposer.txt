### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `DotDecomposer` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain a non-canonical dot operation. A dot operation is considered non-canonical if it meets any of the following conditions:

1. There is more than one contracting dimension.
2. It has more than one non-contracting dimension.
3. The batch dimensions, if present, are not canonical.

Here is an example of a non-canonical dot operation in TensorFlow:

```python
# Assume a, b are tensors with appropriate shapes
c = tf.tensordot(a, b, axes=[[1, 2], [0, 1]])
```

In this example, the dot operation is non-canonical because it has more than one contracting dimension. The `DotDecomposer` optimization pass will be triggered to convert this non-canonical dot operation into a canonical form.
