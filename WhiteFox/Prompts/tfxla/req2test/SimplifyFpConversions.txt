### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `ReshapeReshapeForwarding` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.reshape(input_tensor, ...)
t2 = tf.reshape(t1, input_tensor.shape)
```
The pattern describes that there are two reshape operators in the model. The first `reshape` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from `input_tensor.shape` to any new shape, and the second `reshape` operator transforms the output of first `reshape` back to `input_tensor.shape`.


# Model
class Model(tf.keras.Model):

  def __init__(self):
    super(Model, self).__init__()

  def call(self, x1):
    x2 = tf.reshape(x1, [2,2])
    return tf.reshape(x2, [4])

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
input_shape = [4]
x1 = tf.constant([4.,5.,6.,7.], shape=input_shape)

# Call model
y = m(x1)


### Please generate one valid TensorFlow model that satisfies requirements below.
You should only use public TensorFlow APIs. The model can be used as the input to trigger the optimization pass `SimplifyFpConversions` in TensorFlow XLA.

# Description
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = tf.cast(input_tensor, dtype1)
t2 = tf.cast(t1, dtype2)
t3 = tf.cast(t2, dtype3)
```
The pattern describes that there are multiple consecutive cast operators in the model. The first `cast` operator transforms a tensor input `input_tensor` from its original data type to `dtype1`, the second `cast` operator transforms the output of the first `cast` from `dtype1` to `dtype2`, and the third `cast` operator transforms the output of the second `cast` from `dtype2` to `dtype3`.

The optimization `SimplifyFpConversions` is triggered when there are at least two consecutive cast operations in the model and the final data type is either the same as the original data type or different. If the final data type is the same as the original, the intermediate cast operations are removed. If the final data type is different, the intermediate cast operations are replaced with a single cast operation from the original data type to the final data type.
