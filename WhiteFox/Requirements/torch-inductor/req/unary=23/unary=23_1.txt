The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = torch.tanh(t1) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the transposed convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise transposed convolution is applied to an input tensor, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the output of the transposed convolution.
