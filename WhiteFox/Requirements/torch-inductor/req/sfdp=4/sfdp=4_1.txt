The model should contain the following pattern:
```
qk = query @ key.transpose(-2, -1) / math.sqrt(query.size(-1)) # Compute the dot product of the query and key, and scale it
qk = qk + attn_mask # Add the attention mask to the scaled dot product
attn_weight = torch.softmax(qk, dim=-1) # Apply softmax to the result
output = attn_weight @ value # Compute the dot product of the attention weights and the value
```
This pattern characterizes a scaled dot-product attention mechanism, which is a key component of Transformer models. In this mechanism, the attention weights are computed as the softmax of the scaled dot product of the query and key tensors, and these weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value tensor. The attention mask is used to prevent attention to certain positions.
