The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add another tensor to the output of the linear transformation
t3 = relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, then another tensor is added to the output of the linear transformation, and finally the ReLU activation function is applied to the result. The `other` tensor is passed as a keyword argument.
