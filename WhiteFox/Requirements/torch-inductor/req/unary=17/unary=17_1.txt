The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the transposed convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise transposed convolution is applied to an input tensor, and then the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of the transposed convolution.
