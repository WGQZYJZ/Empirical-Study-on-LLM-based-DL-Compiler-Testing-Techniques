The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = t1 > 0 # Create a mask where each element is True if the corresponding element in t1 is greater than 0, False otherwise
t3 = t1 * negative_slope # Multiply the output of the transposed convolution by the negative slope
t4 = torch.where(t2, t1, t3) # Apply the where function to select elements from t1 or t3 based on the mask t2
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise transposed convolution is applied to an input tensor, then a mask is created based on whether each element in the output of the convolution is greater than `0`. The output of the convolution is then multiplied by a negative slope. The `torch.where` function is used to select elements from the output of the convolution or the result of the multiplication based on the mask. This is a typical pattern for a Leaky ReLU operation following a transposed convolution.
