The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add another tensor to the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, and then another tensor (specified by the keyword argument "other") is added to the output of the linear transformation.
