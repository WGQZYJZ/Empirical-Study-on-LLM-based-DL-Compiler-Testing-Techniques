The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = torch.tanh(t1) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the output of the linear transformation. This is a common pattern in neural networks where activation functions like tanh are applied after linear transformations.
