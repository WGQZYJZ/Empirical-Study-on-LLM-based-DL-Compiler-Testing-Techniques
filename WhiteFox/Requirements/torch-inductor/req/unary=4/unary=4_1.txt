The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the linear transformation
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the linear transformation is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the linear transformation, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the linear transformation is multiplied by the output of the error function.
