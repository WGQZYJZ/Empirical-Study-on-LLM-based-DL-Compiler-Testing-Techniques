The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * t1 # Square the output of the convolution
t4 = t3 * t1 # Cube the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 * 0.044715 # Multiply the cube of the output of the convolution by 0.044715
t6 = t1 + t5 # Add the output of the convolution to the result of the previous operation
t7 = t6 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the result of the previous operation by 0.7978845608028654
t8 = torch.tanh(t7) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the result of the previous operation
t9 = t8 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t10 = t2 * t9 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is squared, cubed, and then multiplied by a constant `0.044715`, and then the output of the convolution is added to the result of the previous operation, and then the result of the previous operation is multiplied by another constant `0.7978845608028654`, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the result of the previous operation, and then `1` is added to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function.
