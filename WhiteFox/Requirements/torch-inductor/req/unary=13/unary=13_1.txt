The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = sigmoid(t1) # Apply the sigmoid function to the output of the linear transformation
t3 = t1 * t2 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by the output of the sigmoid function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation is passed through a sigmoid function, and then the output of the sigmoid function is multiplied by the output of the linear transformation. This is a typical pattern for a gating mechanism, where the sigmoid function controls the flow of information from the linear transformation.
