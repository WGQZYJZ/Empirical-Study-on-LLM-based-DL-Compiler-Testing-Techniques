The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the transposed convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * t1 * t1 # Cube the output of the transposed convolution
t4 = t3 * 0.044715 # Multiply the cubed output by 0.044715
t5 = t1 + t4 # Add the output of the transposed convolution to the output of the multiplication
t6 = t5 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the output of the addition by 0.7978845608028654
t7 = torch.tanh(t6) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the multiplication
t8 = t7 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t9 = t2 * t8 # Multiply the output of the multiplication by the output of the addition
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise transposed convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the transposed convolution is cubed, and then the cubed output is multiplied by another constant `0.044715`, and then the output of the transposed convolution is added to the output of the multiplication, and then the output of the addition is multiplied by another constant `0.7978845608028654`, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the output of the multiplication, and then `1` is added to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function, and then the output of the multiplication is multiplied by the output of the addition.
