The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.nn.functional.linear(input_tensor, ...) # Apply linear transformation to the input tensor.
t2 = t1.permute(...) # Permute the output tensor from the linear transformation.
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the `torch.nn.functional.linear` function is invoked first on an input tensor, and then the tensor method 'permute' is invoked on the output tensor of the linear function.
The linear function is applied to an input tensor, and then the permute method is invoked on the output tensor with more than 2 dimensions, and it swaps the last two dimensions of this tensor.
