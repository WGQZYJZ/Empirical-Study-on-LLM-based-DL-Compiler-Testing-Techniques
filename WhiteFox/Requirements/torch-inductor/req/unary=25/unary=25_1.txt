The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 > 0 # Create a boolean tensor where each element is True if the corresponding element in t1 is greater than 0, and False otherwise
t3 = t1 * negative_slope # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by the negative slope
t4 = torch.where(t2, t1, t3) # For each element in t2, if the element is True, choose the corresponding element from t1, otherwise choose the corresponding element from t3
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, then a boolean tensor is created where each element is True if the corresponding element in the output of the linear transformation is greater than 0, and False otherwise. Then, the output of the linear transformation is multiplied by a negative slope. Finally, for each element in the boolean tensor, if the element is True, the corresponding element from the output of the linear transformation is chosen, otherwise the corresponding element from the output of the multiplication by the negative slope is chosen. This is essentially implementing the Leaky ReLU activation function.
