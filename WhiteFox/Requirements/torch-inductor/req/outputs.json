Here are the characteristics of such a pattern:\n\nThe model should contain operations as follows:\n\n1. **Permute Operation**:\n   - The model uses the `permute` method on a tensor with more than 2 dimensions.\n   - This `permute` operation specifically swaps the last two dimensions of the tensor.\n\n2. **Linear Transformation**:\n   - The permuted tensor is then passed as the input to a `torch.nn.functional.linear` function.\n   - This linear function operation is then cached in a node of the computation graph.\n\nIn code, this pattern looks like:\n```python\nt1 = input_tensor.permute(...)  # t1 is a tensor with permute operation applied\nt2 = torch.nn.functional.linear(t1, weight, bias)  # Apply linear transformation\n```\n\n### Key Requirements:\n\n- **Permuted Tensor**: The `permute` call on the input tensor must have more than two dimensions and should rearrange the last two dimensions.\n- **Subsequent Linear Operation**: The output of the `permute` operation (i.e., `t1`) should be directly fed into a `torch.nn.functional.linear` operation (i.e., `t2`).\n\nThe combination of these characteristics allows the function `permute_linear_fusion` to identify the opportunity to apply optimization by fusing these operations, resulting in the erasure of the linear node due to the successful creation of a fused node."
