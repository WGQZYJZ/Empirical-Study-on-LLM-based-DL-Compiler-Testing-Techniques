t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
t3 = t1 + (t1 * t1 * t1) * 0.044715 # Add the output of the linear transformation to the output of the linear transformation cubed multiplied by 0.044715
t4 = t3 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the output of the previous operation by 0.7978845608028654
t5 = torch.tanh(t4) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the previous operation
t6 = t5 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t7 = t2 * t6 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
