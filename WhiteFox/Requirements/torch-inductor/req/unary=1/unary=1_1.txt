The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
t3 = t1 + (t1 * t1 * t1) * 0.044715 # Add the output of the linear transformation to the output of the linear transformation cubed multiplied by 0.044715
t4 = t3 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the output of the previous operation by 0.7978845608028654
t5 = torch.tanh(t4) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the previous operation
t6 = t5 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t7 = t2 * t6 # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the linear transformation is added to the output of the linear transformation cubed multiplied by `0.044715`, and then the output of the previous operation is multiplied by `0.7978845608028654`, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the output of the previous operation, and then `1` is added to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function, and then the output of the linear transformation is multiplied by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function.
