The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.cat(input_tensors, dim=1) # Concatenate input tensors along dimension 1
t2 = t1[:, 0:9223372036854775807] # Slice the concatenated tensor along dimension 1
t3 = t2[:, 0:size] # Further slice the tensor along dimension 1
t4 = torch.cat([t1, t3], dim=1) # Concatenate the original concatenated tensor and the sliced tensor along dimension 1
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a list of tensors are concatenated along dimension 1, then a slice of the concatenated tensor is taken along dimension 1, then another slice of the tensor is taken along dimension 1, and then the original concatenated tensor and the sliced tensor are concatenated along dimension 1.
