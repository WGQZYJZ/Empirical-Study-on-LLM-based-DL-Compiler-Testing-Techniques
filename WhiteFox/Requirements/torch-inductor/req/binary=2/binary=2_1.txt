The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other # Subtract 'other' from the output of the convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is subtracted by another tensor or scalar (referred to as 'other'). The 'other' could be a tensor of the same shape as the output of the convolution or a scalar.
