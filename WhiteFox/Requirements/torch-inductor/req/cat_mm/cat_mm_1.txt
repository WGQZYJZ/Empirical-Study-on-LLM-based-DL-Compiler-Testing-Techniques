The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.mm(input1, input2) # Matrix multiplication of two input tensors
t2 = torch.cat([t1, t1, ..., t1]) # Concatenation of the result tensor along a specified dimension
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a matrix multiplication operation is concatenated along a certain dimension. The number of times the matrix multiplication result is concatenated depends on the length of the list in the `torch.cat` function.
