The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other # Subtract 'other' from the output of the linear transformation
t3 = relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, then a certain value (referred to as 'other') is subtracted from the output of the linear transformation, and finally, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the result.
