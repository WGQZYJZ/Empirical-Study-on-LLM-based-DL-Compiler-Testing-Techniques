The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = sigmoid(t1) # Apply the sigmoid function to the output of the convolution
t3 = t1 * t2 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the sigmoid function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is passed through a sigmoid activation function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the sigmoid function. This is a typical pattern for a gating mechanism, where the sigmoid function controls the flow of information from the convolution.
