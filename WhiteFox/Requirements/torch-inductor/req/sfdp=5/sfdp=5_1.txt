The model should contain the following pattern:
```
qk = query @ key.transpose(-2, -1) / math.sqrt(query.size(-1)) # Compute the dot product of the query and key, and scale it
qk = qk + attn_mask # Add the attention mask to the scaled dot product
attn_weight = torch.softmax(qk, dim=-1) # Apply softmax to the result
attn_weight = torch.dropout(attn_weight, dropout_p, True) # Apply dropout to the softmax output
output = attn_weight @ value # Compute the dot product of the dropout output and the value
```
This pattern characterizes the attention mechanism in transformer models, where the attention weights are computed as the softmax of the scaled dot product of the query and key (plus an attention mask), followed by a dropout operation. The output is then computed as the dot product of these attention weights and the value.
