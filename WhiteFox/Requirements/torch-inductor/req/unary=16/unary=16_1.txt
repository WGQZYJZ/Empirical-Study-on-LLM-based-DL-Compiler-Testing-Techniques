The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied to an input tensor, and then the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of the linear transformation. This is a common pattern in many neural network architectures, where a linear transformation is followed by a non-linear activation function.
