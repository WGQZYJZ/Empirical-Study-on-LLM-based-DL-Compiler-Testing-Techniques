The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + 3 # Add 3 to the output of the convolution
t3 = torch.clamp_min(t2, 0) # Clamp the output of the addition operation to a minimum of 0
t4 = torch.clamp_max(t3, 6) # Clamp the output of the previous operation to a maximum of 6
t5 = t1 * t4 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the clamp operation
t6 = t5 / 6 # Divide the output of the multiplication operation by 6
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is added to a constant `3`, then the result is clamped to a minimum of `0` and a maximum of `6`, then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the clamped result, and finally the result of the multiplication is divided by `6`. This pattern is often used in implementations of the ReLU6 activation function, which is a variant of the ReLU activation function that caps the maximum output value at `6`.
