The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.addmm(input, mat1, mat2) # Perform a matrix multiplication of mat1 and mat2 and add it to the input
t2 = torch.cat([t1], dim) # Concatenate the result along a specified dimension
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a matrix multiplication is performed between two tensors and then added to an input tensor. The result of this operation is then concatenated along a specified dimension. This is a common pattern in fully connected layers followed by a concatenation operation.
