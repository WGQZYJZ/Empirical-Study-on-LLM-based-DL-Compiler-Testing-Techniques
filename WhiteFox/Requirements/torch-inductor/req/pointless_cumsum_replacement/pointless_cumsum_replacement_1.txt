The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.full([arg1, arg2], 1, dtype=dtype, layout=layout, device=device, pin_memory=False) # Create a tensor filled with the scalar value 1, with the specified dtype, layout, and device
t2 = convert_element_type(t1, dtype) # Convert the elements of the tensor to the specified dtype
t3 = torch.cumsum(t2, 1) # Compute the cumulative sum of the elements of the tensor along dimension 1
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a tensor filled with the scalar value `1` is created with the specified dtype, layout, and device, then the elements of the tensor are converted to the specified dtype, and then the cumulative sum of the elements of the tensor is computed along dimension `1`.
