The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add another tensor to the output of the convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is added to another tensor. The "other" tensor is passed as a keyword argument to the addition operation.
