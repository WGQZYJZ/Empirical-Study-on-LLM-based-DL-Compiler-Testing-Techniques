The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other # Subtract a value, named "other", from the output of the convolution
t3 = torch.relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result of the subtraction
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is subtracted by a variable (referred to as "other") and subsequently passed through a ReLU activation function, which zeroes out negative values and retains positive values.
