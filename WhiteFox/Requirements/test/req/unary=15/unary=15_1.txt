The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the convolution
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is immediately passed through a ReLU activation function. The convolution operation executed is a direct application with a kernel size of 1, which often serves as a simple transformation or feature selector on the input tensor before being non-linearly activated by ReLU.
