The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = transposed_conv(input_tensor)  # Apply a transposed pointwise convolution to the input tensor
t2 = torch.sigmoid(t1)  # Apply the sigmoid activation function to the output of the transposed convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a transposed pointwise convolution (deconvolution with kernel size 1) is directly passed to a sigmoid activation function.
