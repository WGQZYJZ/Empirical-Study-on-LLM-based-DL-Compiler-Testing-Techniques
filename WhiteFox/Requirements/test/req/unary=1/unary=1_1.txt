The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
u1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
u2 = u1 * 0.5  # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
u3 = linear(input_tensor)  # Reapply the same linear transformation
u4 = linear(input_tensor)  # Reapply the same linear transformation
u5 = linear(input_tensor)  # Reapply the same linear transformation
u6 = u4 * u5  # Multiply two repeated outputs of the linear transformation
u7 = u3 * u6  # Multiply one linear output with the result of the previous multiplication
u8 = u7 * 0.044715  # Multiply the product by constant 0.044715
u9 = u1 + u8  # Add the multiplied product to the initial linear output
u10 = u9 * 0.7978845608028654  # Multiply the sum by another constant 0.7978845608028654
u11 = torch.tanh(u10)  # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function
u12 = u11 + 1  # Add 1 to the output of the tanh function
output = u2 * u12  # Multiply the modified initial linear output by the sum of 1 and tanh
```

This pattern involves a sequence of linear transformations on the input followed by element-wise multiplications, additions, and non-linear activations. Specifically, the model applies a linear transformation, scales it, and performs a series of element-wise multiplications and non-linear transformations (tanh) before combining the results. The repeated linear transformations and specific scaling constants suggest a model structure similar to some common architectures involving attention mechanisms or similar transformations.
