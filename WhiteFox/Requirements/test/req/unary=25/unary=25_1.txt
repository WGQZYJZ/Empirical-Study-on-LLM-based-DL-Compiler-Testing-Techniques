The model should contain the following pattern, which resembles a Parametric ReLU (PReLU) activation function applied after a linear transformation:

```python
# Perform a linear transformation on the input tensor
t1 = linear(input_tensor) 

# Create a mask where tensor values are greater than zero
mask = t1 > 0 

# Apply the linear transformation to the input and use the mask to select the positive values
positive_part = torch.where(mask, t1, torch.zeros_like(t1))

# Calculate the output for the negative slope part
negative_part = t1 * negative_slope

# Use the mask to apply the PReLU activation function, 
# selecting between the positive part (leave as is) and negative part (scaled by negative_slope)
output = torch.where(mask, positive_part, negative_part)
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear layer is followed by a condition that applies a parametric ReLU activation function, using a learnable parameter `negative_slope` to scale the negative part of the input. The model utilizes `aten.where` to conditionally select between input values when they are greater than zero and values scaled by the `negative_slope` otherwise.
