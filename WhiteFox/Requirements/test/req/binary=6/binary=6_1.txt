The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation (fully connected layer) to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other # Subtract another tensor or a constant (referred to as "other") from the result of the linear layer
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation is directly subtracted by a tensor or a scalar referred to as "other". The linear transformation is realized using the `mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default` function which suggests the use of MKL-DNN optimizations for pointwise operations following the linear layer.
