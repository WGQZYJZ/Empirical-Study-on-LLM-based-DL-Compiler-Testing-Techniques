The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.sigmoid(conv(input_tensor))  # Apply another pointwise convolution and then perform the sigmoid activation on its output
t3 = t1 * t2  # Multiply the output of the first convolution by the sigmoid-activated output of the second convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by the sigmoid function applied to the output of another pointwise convolution. This structure might represent a form of feature gating or attention-like mechanism, where the output of an operation is modulated by its interaction with another non-linear transformation of the original input, inside a neural network model.
