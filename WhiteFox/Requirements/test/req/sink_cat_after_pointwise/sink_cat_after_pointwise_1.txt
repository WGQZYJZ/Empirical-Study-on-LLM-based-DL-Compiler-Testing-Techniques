The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.cat([tensor_a, tensor_b, ...], dim=...)  # Concatenate tensors along a specific dimension
t2 = t1.view(...)  # Apply a 'view' operation on the concatenated result
t3 = torch.relu(t2)  # Apply a pointwise unary operation (e.g., ReLU, Tanh) on the resulting tensor
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where `torch.cat` is applied to concatenate tensors, and the result undergoes at least one `view` method before being acted upon by a pointwise unary operation (like `torch.relu` or `torch.tanh`). 

The `g.erase_node(node)` line is triggered when the original `torch.cat` node (or its output) is no longer required after reordering and replacing the operations in the graph.
