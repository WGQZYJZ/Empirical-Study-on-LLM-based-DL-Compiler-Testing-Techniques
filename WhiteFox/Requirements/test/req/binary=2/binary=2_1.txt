The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other_value  # Subtract a specified `other_value` from the output of the convolution
```

This pattern characterizes a scenario where the output of a pointwise convolution is directly subtracted by a specified value (`other_value`). The convolution operation is using MKLDNN with convolution implemented as a pointwise operation, potentially optimizing for hardware-specific execution paths.
