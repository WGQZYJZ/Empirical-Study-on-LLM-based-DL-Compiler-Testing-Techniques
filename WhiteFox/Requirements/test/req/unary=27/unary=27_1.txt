The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.clamp_min(t1, min_value) # Clamp the output of the convolution to have a minimum value of 'min_value'
t3 = torch.clamp_max(t2, max_value) # Clamp the result of the minimum clamp to have a maximum value of 'max_value'
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is subjected to a dual clamping operation, initially clamping the values to not go below a specified minimum (`min_value`), followed by further clamping them to not exceed a specified maximum (`max_value`).
