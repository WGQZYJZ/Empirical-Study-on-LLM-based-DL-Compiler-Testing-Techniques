The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add another tensor or a constant to the output of the convolution
t3 = torch.relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function to the result
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is combined with another tensor or constant using an addition operation, followed by the application of the ReLU activation function on the resulting tensor to ensure that all the negative values are set to zero.
