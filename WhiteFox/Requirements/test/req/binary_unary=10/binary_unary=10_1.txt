The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add a bias or another tensor to the output of the linear transformation
t3 = torch.relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation (like a fully connected layer) is added to another tensor (which could be a bias or any other tensor) and then a ReLU activation function is applied to the resultant tensor. This sequence typically captures a linear layer followed by an addition operation and a non-linear activation function, common components of many neural network models.
