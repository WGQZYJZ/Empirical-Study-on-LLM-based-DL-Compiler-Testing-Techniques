The model contains a pattern where a pointwise linear transformation, often implemented as a linear layer with a kernel size of 1, is immediately followed by the application of the ReLU activation function. This pattern can often be represented as:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = torch.relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the linear transformation
```

This pattern characterizes models where a linear layer's output is non-linearly transformed using the ReLU activation, a common motif in neural network architectures.
