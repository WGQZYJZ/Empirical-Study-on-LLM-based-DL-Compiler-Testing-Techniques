The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor using a pointwise operation
t2 = torch.sigmoid(t1) # Apply the sigmoid activation function to the output of the linear transformation
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation (possibly using optimized MKL-DNN operations) is directly passed through a sigmoid activation function.
