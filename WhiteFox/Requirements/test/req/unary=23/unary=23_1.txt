The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor)  # Apply a transposed pointwise convolution to the input tensor
t2 = torch.tanh(t1)  # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the transposed convolution
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a transposed pointwise convolution is directly fed into the hyperbolic tangent activation function (`tanh`).
