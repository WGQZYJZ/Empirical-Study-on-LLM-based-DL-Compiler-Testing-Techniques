The PyTorch model that can trigger the `module.graph.erase_node(node)` line within the `permute_linear_fusion` optimization must exhibit a specific sequence of operations that matches the optimization pattern laid out in the `permute_linear_fusion` function. The key characteristics of this model are as follows:

1. **Tensor Permutation Operation**:
   - An input tensor is subjected to a `permute` operation. This tensor must have more than two dimensions (rank > 2).
   - The `permute` operation specifically rearranges the dimensions of the tensor such that the last two dimensions are swapped.

2. **Linear Transformation**:
   - A `torch.nn.functional.linear` operation is applied immediately after the `permute` operation, taking the permuted tensor as its input.

3. **Graph Structure**:
   - Within the computational graph, the node representing the `linear` operation traces its input back to the output of a `permute` operation.
   - The permutation and linear operation nodes must be connected directly, with no intervening operations or uses that would prevent the `permute_linear_fusion` from simplifying the computation.

4. **Node Usage**:
   - The `linear` node and potentially the `permute` node must have no other uses within the graph once the fusion is applied, allowing them to be safely erased.

The optimization targets unnecessary computation by combining the `permute` and `linear` operations into a single optimized operation (`transpose_linear`). 

### Example Code:

```python
import torch

# Define an example function
def example_function(input_tensor):
    # Permute the last two dimensions
    permuted_tensor = input_tensor.permute(0, 2, 1)
    # Apply a linear transformation
    output_tensor = torch.nn.functional.linear(permuted_tensor, weight, bias)
    return output_tensor

# Create a PyTorch FX GraphModule for transformation
graph_module = torch.fx.symbolic_trace(example_function)
optimized_graph_module = permute_linear_fusion(graph_module)
```

In this example:
- `input_tensor.permute(0, 2, 1)` represents the swap of the last two dimensions.
- `torch.nn.functional.linear(permuted_tensor, weight, bias)` is the linear operation performed on the permuted tensor.
- The dimensions in the `permute` function should match the pattern expected by `check_permute`, specifically, they should swap the last two dimensions.

This pattern in the model is what allows the
