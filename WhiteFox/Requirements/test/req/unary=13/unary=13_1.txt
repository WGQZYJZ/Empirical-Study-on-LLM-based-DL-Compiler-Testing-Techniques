The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply the same linear transformation again to the input tensor

t3 = torch.sigmoid(t2)  # Apply the sigmoid function to the second output
t4 = t1 * t3  # Element-wise multiply the first linear output by the sigmoid output
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a linear transformation is applied twice to the same input tensor. The output of the second linear transformation is fed through a sigmoid activation function, and the result is element-wise multiplied by the output of the first linear transformation. This pattern is similar to the gating mechanism found in some neural network architectures.
