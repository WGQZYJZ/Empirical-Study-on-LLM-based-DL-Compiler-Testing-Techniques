The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv(input_tensor)  # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5  # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = conv(input_tensor) + (t1 * t1 * t1) * 0.044715  # Add to another convolution result the product of the cubic convolution output and 0.044715
t4 = t3 * 0.7978845608028654  # Multiply the result by 0.7978845608028654
t5 = torch.tanh(t4)  # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function
t6 = t5 + 1  # Add 1 to the result of the hyperbolic tangent
t7 = t2 * t6  # Multiply the scaled convolution output by the modified hyperbolic tangent result
```

This pattern involves using a pointwise convolution, followed by a sequence of arithmetic operations involving multiplication by specific constants, performing element-wise summation, application of the hyperbolic tangent function, and further multiplication that may hint towards a transformation leveraging characteristics similar to those of activation functions or specialized processing blocks found in certain architectures.
