t2 = t1 * 0.5  # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = conv(input_tensor) + (t1 * t1 * t1) * 0.044715  # Add to another convolution result the product of the cubic convolution output and 0.044715
t4 = t3 * 0.7978845608028654  # Multiply the result by 0.7978845608028654
t5 = torch.tanh(t4)  # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function
t6 = t5 + 1  # Add 1 to the result of the hyperbolic tangent
t7 = t2 * t6  # Multiply the scaled convolution output by the modified hyperbolic tangent result
