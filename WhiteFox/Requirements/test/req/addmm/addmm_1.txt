The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = torch.mm(input_matrix1, input_matrix2)  # Perform matrix multiplication between two input matrices
t2 = t1 + inp  # Add the result of the matrix multiplication to another tensor named inp
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the result of a matrix multiplication operation (`torch.mm`) is added to another input tensor (`inp`). The use of matrix multiplication suggests that this model performs some form of linear transformations or projections, and incorporates the result into its computation by adding it to the tensor `inp`.
