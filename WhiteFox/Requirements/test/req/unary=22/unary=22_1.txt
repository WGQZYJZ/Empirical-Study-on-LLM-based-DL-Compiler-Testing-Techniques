The pattern you provided characterizes a specific type of layer sequence in a PyTorch model. Here is a concise description:

The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = torch.tanh(t1) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent activation function to the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern describes a scenario where the output of a linear transformation (typically a fully connected layer or dense layer) is passed through a hyperbolic tangent activation function. This is a common sequence in neural network structures where `tanh` is used as the activation function following a linear layer defined by the `mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default` operation.
