The described pattern characterizes a PyTorch model that contains the following sequence of operations:

```python
# Perform a pointwise convolution (likely a 1x1 convolution) on the input tensor
t1 = conv(input_tensor) 

# Add an external tensor or constant to the result of the convolution
t2 = t1 + other 

# Apply the ReLU activation function to the result
output = torch.relu(t2) 
```

This pattern typically indicates a model where the output of a pointwise convolution is offset by a fixed tensor or scalar (`other`), and the result is then passed through a ReLU activation function. This sequence is common in residual networks and other architectures that use skip connections with activation functions.
