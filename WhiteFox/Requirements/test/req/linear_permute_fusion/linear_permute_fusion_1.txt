The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = torch.nn.functional.linear(input_tensor, ...) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1.permute(...) # Permute the output of the linear transformation
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the `torch.nn.functional.linear` function is first applied to a tensor with more than 2 dimensions, and the result of this function is then utilized as the main input to the `permute` method. The `permute` method is invoked to swap the last two dimensions of the tensor obtained from the linear transformation.
