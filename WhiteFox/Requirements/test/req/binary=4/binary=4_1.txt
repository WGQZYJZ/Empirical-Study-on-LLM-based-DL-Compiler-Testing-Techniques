The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add a separate tensor or scalar ('other') to the output of the linear transformation
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear operation is immediately followed by an addition operation, which adds another tensor or scalar to the output. The presence of `mkldnn._linear_pointwise.default` suggests that the model utilizes a pointwise linear layer optimized for MKLDNN backends.
