The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the transposed convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the transposed convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the scaled output of the transposed convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the result of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the scaled output of the transposed convolution by the adjusted result of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise transposed convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, then another output from the same transposed convolution is multiplied by a different constant `0.7071067811865476`, the error function is applied to this latter product, `1` is added to the result of the error function, and finally, this result is multiplied with the first scaled output of the transposed convolution.
