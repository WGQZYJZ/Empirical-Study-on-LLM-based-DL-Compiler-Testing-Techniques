The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a pointwise linear (fully connected) operation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other_value      # Add a constant or another tensor called "other" to the output of the linear operation
t3 = torch.relu(t2)        # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result of the addition
```

This pattern is characteristic of models that consist of a pointwise (element-wise) linear transformation followed by addition with a constant or another input, and then a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation is applied to the combined output. This sequence can often be found in layers within neural networks used for regression or classification tasks, where activation functions like ReLU are commonly employed to introduce non-linearity.
