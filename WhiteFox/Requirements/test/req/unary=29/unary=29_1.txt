The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply a transposed pointwise convolution with a kernel size of 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.clamp_min(t1, min_value) # Clamp the minimum values of the output of the convolution to `min_value`
t3 = torch.clamp_max(t2, max_value) # Clamp the maximum values of the output to `max_value`
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a transposed pointwise convolution is applied to an input tensor, followed by clamping the result to a specified minimum and maximum range defined by `min_value` and `max_value`, respectively.
