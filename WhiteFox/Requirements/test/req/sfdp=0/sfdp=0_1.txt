The model should contain the following pattern, which characterizes a scaled dot-product attention mechanism commonly found in transformer models:

```python
# Calculate the scaled dot-product attention
# Compute the attention scores by multiplying query with the transposed key
attention_scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))

# Scale the attention scores
scaled_attention_scores = attention_scores.div(inv_scale)

# Apply the softmax function to obtain attention weights
attention_weights = scaled_attention_scores.softmax(dim=-1)

# Multiply the attention weights by the value tensor
attention_output = attention_weights.matmul(value)
```

This pattern specifically involves the following operations:

- Multiplication of a query tensor with the transposed key tensor to compute attention scores.
- Scaling the resulting attention scores by a constant `inv_scale`.
- Applying the softmax function along the last dimension to obtain normalized attention weights.
- Multiplying the attention weights by the value tensor to compute the final attention output.

This sequence of operations is integral to attention mechanisms utilized in transformer-based models, facilitating the focus on different parts of the input sequence when making predictions.
