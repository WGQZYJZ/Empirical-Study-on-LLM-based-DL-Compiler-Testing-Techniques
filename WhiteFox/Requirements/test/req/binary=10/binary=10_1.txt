The model should contain the following pattern:

```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply the linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add the result of the linear transformation to another tensor
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a linear transformation, such as a fully connected layer, is added to another tensor, given by the keyword argument `other`. The linear transformation uses the MKLDNN backend for performance optimization.
