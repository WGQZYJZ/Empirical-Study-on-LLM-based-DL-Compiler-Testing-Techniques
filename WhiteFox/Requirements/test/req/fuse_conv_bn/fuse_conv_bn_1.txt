The model should contain specific layer sequences to trigger the optimization, specifically involving Convolution and Batch Normalization layers. There are two main patterns that can trigger the `gm.graph.erase_node(node)` line in the `fuse_conv_bn` function:

1. **Pattern involving `torch.nn` modules**:
   - A **Conv** layer followed by a matching **BatchNorm** layer, both from `torch.nn` and of the same dimensionality (e.g., `Conv2d` and `BatchNorm2d`).
   - The Convolution layer is applied to an input tensor, and its output is directly used as the input for the subsequent Batch Normalization layer.
   - The Convolution and BatchNorm layers should be in evaluation mode, and the BatchNorm should have tracking running statistics enabled.
   - No other node in the graph should use the output of the Conv layer before it is passed to the BatchNorm layer.

2. **Pattern involving a mix of `torch.nn` and `torch.nn.functional` calls**:
   - A **Conv** layer from `torch.nn` followed by `torch.nn.functional.batch_norm`.
   - The arguments for `batch_norm` include constants for running mean, running var, weight, and bias, and the `eps` argument should be a float.
   - The Convolution and batch normalization arguments should be structured such that the Conv layer is not in training mode and the batch normalization is not applied in training mode.
   - The batch normalization operation should prioritize constant batch norm arguments, ensuring they are fetched attributes with single usages.

Both patterns involve fusing the Convolution and Batch Normalization operations into a single operation, allowing the removal of the Batch Normalization node (`gm.graph.erase_node(node)`). 

Example code illustrating a typical pattern:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ExampleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ExampleModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=16, kernel_size=3)
        self.bn = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.bn(x)
        return x

model = ExampleModel()
```
This model would have a `Conv2d` followed by a `BatchNorm2d`, matching the `modules_patterns` structure within the `fuse_conv_bn` function.
