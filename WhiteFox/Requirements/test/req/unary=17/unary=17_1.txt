The model should contain the following pattern:

```python
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = torch.relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the transposed convolution
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise transposed convolution is followed by a ReLU activation function. The transposed convolution is performed using MKL-DNN optimized operations and the result is subsequently passed through a ReLU activation to ensure non-negative outputs. This pattern is often used in neural networks, particularly in architectures such as generator networks in GANs or decoder parts of autoencoders, where upsampling or feature expansion is required.
