The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = linear(input_tensor) # Apply a linear transformation to the input tensor
t2 = t1 - other # Subtract a specified value 'other' from the output of the linear layer
t3 = torch.relu(t2) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the result of the subtraction
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where:
1. A linear transformation is applied to the input tensor using a pointwise operation.
2. The result of this transformation is subtracted by a constant or variable (`other`).
3. The ReLU activation function is then applied to the result of the subtraction.
