The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
l1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a linear transformation (pointwise linear layer) to the input tensor
l2 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply the same linear transformation to the input tensor (used twice)
l3 = l2 + 3  # Add 3 to the output of the second linear transformation
l4 = torch.clamp_min(l3, 0)  # Clamp the result to a minimum value of 0
l5 = torch.clamp_max(l4, 6)  # Clamp the intermediate result to a maximum value of 6
l6 = l1 * l5  # Multiply the output of the first linear transformation by the clamped result
l7 = l6 / 6  # Divide the result of the multiplication by 6
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the same pointwise linear transformation (e.g., matrix multiplication followed by any optional pointwise operation) is applied twice on the input tensor. Then, one output is processed using a two-step clamping operation: first clamping it to a minimum of 0 (`clamp_min`), and then clamping it to a maximum of 6 (`clamp_max`). The output of the first linear transformation is multiplied by this clamped result, and the final result is scaled by dividing it by 6.
