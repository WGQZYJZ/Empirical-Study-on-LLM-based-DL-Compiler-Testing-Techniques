The model should contain the following pattern involving matrix multiplication and addition:

```python
t1 = torch.mm(mat1, mat2)  # Perform matrix multiplication between the first pair of matrices
t2 = torch.mm(mat3, mat4)  # Perform matrix multiplication between the second pair of matrices
t3 = t1 + t2  # Add the results of the two matrix multiplications
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the outputs of two separate matrix multiplications are summed together. This is typically found in models that require linear transformations followed by summation, such as in multilayer perceptrons with linear layers.
