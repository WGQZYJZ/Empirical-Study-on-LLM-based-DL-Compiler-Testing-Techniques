Convolution and Mathematical Transformation Pattern\n\nThe first pattern, which is described initially, characterizes a model containing operations that can be outlined as follows:\n\n```python\n# Applying a pointwise convolution (1x1 kernel)\nt1 = conv(input_tensor) \n\n# Sequential transformations\nt2 = t1 * 0.5 \nt3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476\nt4 = torch.erf(t3) \nt5 = t4 + 1 \nt6 = t2 * t5 \n```\n\nThis pattern indicates a model incorporating pointwise convolution followed sequentially by scalar multiplication, error function application, addition, and further multiplicative interaction between outcomes of these operations.\n\n### 2. SplitWithSizes and Cat Operation Pattern\n\nThe second pattern involves the operations `split_with_sizes` and `cat`, which should align with conditions in the `is_valid_splitwithsizes_cat` function:\n\n```python\n# Given an input tensor, it's split into segments of specified sizes\nsplit_result = torch.split(input_tensor, split_sizes, dim=some_dimension)\n\n# Each segment is accessed via an operation equivalent to: getitem(split_result, index)\n# The elements from the split operation are concatenated back along a specific dimension\nreconstructed_tensor = torch.cat([split_result[i] for i in range(len(split_sizes))], dim=some_dimension)\n```\n\n**Constraints imposed by `is_valid_splitwithsizes_cat`:**\n- **Single Split and Cat Node**: The model must contain exactly one `split_with_sizes` and one `cat` operation.\n- **Dimension Consistency**: The split and concatenate operations must operate along the same dimension.\n- **Full Participation**: All segments obtained by splitting must be included in the concatenation, maintaining complete reconstruction.\n- **Order Consistency**: The order of segments used in the `cat` operation should correspond exactly to the order produced by the `split_with_sizes`.\n\nThis pattern suggests a rearrangement strategy in neural networks, preserving the input structure after specific processing steps, useful in scenarios like attention mechanisms where data fragmentation and reassembly occur frequently."

The specific pattern characterized by the code involves the following sequence of operations:\n\n1. **Matrix Multiplication (Attention Scores Calculation):**  \n   ```python\n   scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1))\n   ```\n   The `query` tensor is multiplied by the transposed `key` tensor to yield attention scores. This is a common operation in attention mechanisms, especially in transformers.\n\n2. **Scaling (Temperature Scaling):**  \n   ```python\n   scaled_scores = scores.div(inv_scale_factor)\n   ```\n   The attention scores are divided by an inverse scaling factor. This scaling is typically applied to stabilize the softmax function and control the sharpness of the attention distribution.\n\n3. **Softmax (Attention Weights Calculation):**  \n   ```python\n   attn_weights = scaled_scores.softmax(dim=-1)\n   ```\n   The softmax function is applied to the scaled attention scores to obtain attention weights. This normalizes the scores to a probability distribution across the last dimension.\n\n4. **Dropout (Regularization):**  \n   ```python\n   dropout_attn_weights = torch.nn.functional.dropout(attn_weights, p=dropout_p)\n   ```\n   Dropout is applied to the attention weights to introduce regularization and prevent overfitting during training. The dropout probability `dropout_p` determines the fraction of elements to zero out.\n\n5. **Weighted Sum (Attention Output Calculation):**  \n   ```python\n   result = dropout_attn_weights.matmul(value)\n   ```\n   The dropout-regularized attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum over the `value` tensor, resulting in the final attention output.\n\nThis pattern essentially describes the attention operation within a multi-head attention layer or a similar construct within a neural network model."

The key characteristics of this model are as follows:\n\n1. **Tensor Permutation Operation**:\n   - An input tensor is subjected to a `permute` operation. This tensor must have more than two dimensions (rank > 2).\n   - The `permute` operation specifically rearranges the dimensions of the tensor such that the last two dimensions are swapped.\n\n2. **Linear Transformation**:\n   - A `torch.nn.functional.linear` operation is applied immediately after the `permute` operation, taking the permuted tensor as its input.\n\n3. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Within the computational graph, the node representing the `linear` operation traces its input back to the output of a `permute` operation.\n   - The permutation and linear operation nodes must be connected directly, with no intervening operations or uses that would prevent the `permute_linear_fusion` from simplifying the computation.\n\n4. **Node Usage**:\n   - The `linear` node and potentially the `permute` node must have no other uses within the graph once the fusion is applied, allowing them to be safely erased.\n\nThe optimization targets unnecessary computation by combining the `permute` and `linear` operations into a single optimized operation (`transpose_linear`). \n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Define an example function\ndef example_function(input_tensor):\n    # Permute the last two dimensions\n    permuted_tensor = input_tensor.permute(0, 2, 1)\n    # Apply a linear transformation\n    output_tensor = torch.nn.functional.linear(permuted_tensor, weight, bias)\n    return output_tensor\n\n# Create a PyTorch FX GraphModule for transformation\ngraph_module = torch.fx.symbolic_trace(example_function)\noptimized_graph_module = permute_linear_fusion(graph_module)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `input_tensor.permute(0, 2, 1)` represents the swap of the last two dimensions.\n- `torch.nn.functional.linear(permuted_tensor, weight, bias)` is the linear operation performed on the permuted tensor.\n- The dimensions in the `permute` function should match the pattern expected by `check_permute`, specifically, they should swap the last two dimensions.\n\nThis pattern in the model is what allows the"
