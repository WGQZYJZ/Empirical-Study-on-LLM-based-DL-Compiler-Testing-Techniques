The model should contain the following pattern:
```python
l1 = linear(input_tensor)  # Apply a pointwise linear transformation (linear layer with kernel size 1) to the input tensor
l2 = l1 * 0.5  # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.5
l3 = l1 * 0.7071067811865476  # Multiply the output of the linear transformation by 0.7071067811865476
l4 = torch.erf(l3)  # Apply the error function to the output of the linear transformation
l5 = l4 + 1  # Add 1 to the output of the error function
l6 = l2 * l5  # Multiply the scaled output of the linear transformation by the output of the error function plus 1
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise linear transformation is concurrently subject to two different scalings: it is first scaled by a constant `0.5`, and separately by another constant `0.7071067811865476` before undergoing a nonlinear transformation via the error function. The modified output is then used to further modify the first scaling result before producing the final output. This pattern might be associated with certain activation functions or custom normalization layers.
