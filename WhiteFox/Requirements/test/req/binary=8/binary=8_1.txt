The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 + other # Add a tensor or scalar `other` to the output of the convolution
```
This pattern represents a scenario where the result of a pointwise convolution operation is followed by an addition operation, where a keyword argument `other` is added to the output of the convolution. The value of `other` can be another tensor that aligns with the dimensions of the convolution output or a scalar that is broadcastable.
