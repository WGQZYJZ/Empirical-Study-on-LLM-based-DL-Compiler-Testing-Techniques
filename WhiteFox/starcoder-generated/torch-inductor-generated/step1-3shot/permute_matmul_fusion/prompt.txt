### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `torch.nn.functional.linear(tensor.permute(...), ...)`. This pattern characterizes scenarios where the torch.nn.functional.linear function is invoked with a tensor method, 'permute',  which rearranges the given tensor's dimensions, as its first argument. 
The permute method is invoked on an input tensor, and it swaps the last two dimensions of this tensor. This modified tensor is then used as the main input for the linear function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)

    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = x1.permute(0, 2, 1)
        v2 = torch.nn.functional.linear(v1, self.linear.weight, self.linear.bias)
        return v1

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 2, 2)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `torch.bmm(tensor.permute(...), ...)` or `torch.matmul(tensor.permute(...), ...)`. This pattern characterizes scenarios where either the torch.bmm or torch.matmul function is invoked with a tensor method, 'permute', which rearranges the given tensor's dimensions, as one of its arguments. 
The permute method is invoked on an input tensor, and it swaps the last two dimensions of this tensor. This modified tensor is then used as one of the inputs for the bmm or matmul function.

In the `permute_matmul_fusion` function, the `module.graph.erase_node(node)` line is reached when either the first or the second argument of the bmm or matmul function is a permuted tensor (or both). After the fusion operation, the original node (bmm or matmul operation) and the permute operation nodes (if they have no other users) are removed from the graph.
