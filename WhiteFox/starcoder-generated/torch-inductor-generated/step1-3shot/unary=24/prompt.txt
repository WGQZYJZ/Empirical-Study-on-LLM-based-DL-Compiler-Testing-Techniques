### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `mul(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.5), add(erf(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.7071067811865476)), 1))`. 
The pattern means the first argument of the outermost operator `mul` is the output of another `mul` operation, which multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.5. The second argument of the outermost `mul` operator is the output of an `add` operation. The `add` operation adds 1 to the output of an `erf` operation, which takes as input the output of a `mul` operation. This `mul` operation multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.7071067811865476.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 3, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x):
        v1 = self.conv(x)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `where(gt(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0), _convolution_pointwise.default, mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, negative_slope))`. 
The pattern means the `where` operator is used to choose between two different outputs based on a condition. The condition is the output of a `gt` (greater than) operation, which checks if the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator is greater than 0. If the condition is true, the output of the `where` operator is the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator. If the condition is false, the output of the `where` operator is the output of a `mul` operation. This `mul` operation multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with the value of the `negative_slope` keyword argument. This pattern is typically seen in the implementation of the Leaky ReLU activation function in neural networks.
