### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `mul(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.5), add(erf(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.7071067811865476)), 1))`. 
The pattern means the first argument of the outermost operator `mul` is the output of another `mul` operation, which multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.5. The second argument of the outermost `mul` operator is the output of an `add` operation. The `add` operation adds 1 to the output of an `erf` operation, which takes as input the output of a `mul` operation. This `mul` operation multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.7071067811865476.

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `softmax((query @ key.transpose(-2, -1) / sqrt(query.size(-1))) + attn_mask)`, followed by a dropout operation, and then a matrix multiplication with `value`. 

The pattern represents a typical attention mechanism used in transformer models. 

First, the dot product of `query` and the transpose of `key` is calculated. This result is then scaled down by the square root of the last dimension of `query`. An attention mask (`attn_mask`) is added to this result to prevent attention to certain positions. The softmax function is applied to this result to obtain the attention weights (`attn_weight`), with the softmax applied across the last dimension.

Next, dropout is applied to the attention weights for regularization. The dropout operation randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. The dropout rate is specified by `dropout_p`, and the operation is performed in-place as indicated by the `True` argument.

Finally, the attention weights are multiplied with `value` to obtain the output of the attention mechanism. This operation represents the weighted sum of the `value` vectors, weighted by the attention weights.
