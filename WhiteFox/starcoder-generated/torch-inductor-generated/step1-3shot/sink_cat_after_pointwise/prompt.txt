### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `torch.nn.functional.linear(tensor.permute(...), ...)`. This pattern characterizes scenarios where the torch.nn.functional.linear function is invoked with a tensor method, 'permute',  which rearranges the given tensor's dimensions, as its first argument. 
The permute method is invoked on an input tensor, and it swaps the last two dimensions of this tensor. This modified tensor is then used as the main input for the linear function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)

    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = x1.permute(0, 2, 1)
        v2 = torch.nn.functional.linear(v1, self.linear.weight, self.linear.bias)
        return v1

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 2, 2)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `torch.cat(...).view(...).relu(...)` or `torch.cat(...).view(...).tanh(...)`. This pattern characterizes scenarios where the `torch.cat` function is invoked to concatenate a sequence of tensors along a new dimension, followed by a `view` method to reshape the tensor, and finally a pointwise unary operation such as `relu` or `tanh` is applied. 

The `sink_cat_after_pointwise` function optimizes this pattern by moving the `cat` operation after the pointwise unary operation. This is done by creating new nodes for the pointwise unary operation for each tensor in the `cat` operation, and then concatenating these new tensors. The original `cat` and pointwise unary operation nodes are then replaced with the new `cat` node and erased from the graph. 

This optimization can be beneficial when the concatenated tensor is large, as it reduces the memory footprint of the operation by applying the pointwise unary operation before concatenation.
