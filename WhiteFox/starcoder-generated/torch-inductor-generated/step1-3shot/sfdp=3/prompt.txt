### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `mul(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.5), add(erf(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.7071067811865476)), 1))`. 
The pattern means the first argument of the outermost operator `mul` is the output of another `mul` operation, which multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.5. The second argument of the outermost `mul` operator is the output of an `add` operation. The `add` operation adds 1 to the output of an `erf` operation, which takes as input the output of a `mul` operation. This `mul` operation multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.7071067811865476.

    def forward(self, x):
        v1 = self.conv(x)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `dropout(matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)).mul(scale_factor).softmax(dim=-1), p=dropout_p).matmul(value)`. 

The pattern means the `dropout` function is applied to the output of a `matmul` operation, which multiplies the `query` tensor with the transposed `key` tensor. The result of this multiplication is then scaled by a `scale_factor` and a softmax operation is applied along the last dimension. The dropout operation itself has a dropout probability of `dropout_p`. The output of the dropout operation is then multiplied with the `value` tensor using another `matmul` operation.

This pattern is commonly seen in attention mechanisms, specifically scaled dot-product attention, used in transformer models. The `query`, `key`, and `value` tensors are typically outputs of linear transformations of the input to the attention layer. The `scale_factor` is typically the square root of the dimension of the `key` tensor, and `dropout_p` is a hyperparameter specifying the dropout probability.
