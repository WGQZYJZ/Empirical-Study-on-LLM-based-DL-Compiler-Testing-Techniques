### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `mul(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.5), add(erf(mul(_convolution_pointwise.default, 0.7071067811865476)), 1))`. 
The pattern means the first argument of the outermost operator `mul` is the output of another `mul` operation, which multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.5. The second argument of the outermost `mul` operator is the output of an `add` operation. The `add` operation adds 1 to the output of an `erf` operation, which takes as input the output of a `mul` operation. This `mul` operation multiplies the output of the `_convolution_pointwise.default` operator with 0.7071067811865476.

# Model

        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 3, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x):
        v1 = self.conv(x)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Inputs to the model

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain a pattern of `dropout(matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)).div(inv_scale_factor).softmax(dim=-1), p=dropout_p).matmul(value)`. 

The pattern means the first argument of the `dropout` function is the output of a `softmax` operation, which takes as input the result of a division operation. This division operation divides the output of a `matmul` operation by `inv_scale_factor`. The `matmul` operation performs a matrix multiplication between `query` and the transpose of `key` along the last two dimensions. 

The `dropout` function then applies dropout to this result with a probability `dropout_p`. The output of the `dropout` function is then used as the input to another `matmul` operation with `value`. 

This pattern is commonly seen in attention mechanisms, specifically scaled dot-product attention, used in transformer models. The dropout is applied to the attention scores to prevent overfitting during training.
