### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the transposed convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise transposed convolution is applied to an input tensor, and then the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of the transposed convolution.
