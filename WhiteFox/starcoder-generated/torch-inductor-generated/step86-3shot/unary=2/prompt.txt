### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the transposed convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * t1 * t1 # Cube the output of the transposed convolution
t4 = t3 * 0.044715 # Multiply the cubed output by 0.044715
t5 = t1 + t4 # Add the output of the transposed convolution to the output of the multiplication
t6 = t5 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the output of the addition by 0.7978845608028654
t7 = torch.tanh(t6) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the multiplication
t8 = t7 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t9 = t2 * t8 # Multiply the output of the multiplication by the output of the addition
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise transposed convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the transposed convolution is cubed, and then the cubed output is multiplied by another constant `0.044715`, and then the output of the transposed convolution is added to the output of the multiplication, and then the output of the addition is multiplied by another constant `0.7978845608028654`, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the output of the multiplication, and then `1` is added to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function, and then the output of the multiplication is multiplied by the output of the addition.
