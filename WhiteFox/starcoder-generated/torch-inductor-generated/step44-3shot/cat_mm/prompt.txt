### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = torch.mm(input1, input2) # Matrix multiplication of two input tensors
t2 = torch.cat([t1, t1, ..., t1]) # Concatenation of the result tensor along a specified dimension
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a matrix multiplication operation is concatenated along a certain dimension. The number of times the matrix multiplication result is concatenated depends on the length of the list in the `torch.cat` function.
