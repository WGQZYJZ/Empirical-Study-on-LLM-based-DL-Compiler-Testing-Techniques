# Description of the model:
# The model implements a function that outputs a result according to function arguments.
#
# Description of the inputs and expected outputs:
# The input tensors x1 and x2 are of size [69, 1]. The output of the function is another tensor v1 of size [33, 2].
#
# List of intermediate tensors:
# t1 (intermediary for the result of the matrix multiplication operation) is of size [69, 2].
# t2 (intermediary for the result of concatenating v1 and t1) is of size [33, 4].
# v1 (result of the matrix multiplication operation) is of size [69, 2].
# v2 (last intermediary for the result of the matrix multiplication operation) is of size [69, 2]. It is equal to v1.
#
# Input to the model
x1 = torch.randn(69, 1)
x2 = torch.randn(1, 2)
