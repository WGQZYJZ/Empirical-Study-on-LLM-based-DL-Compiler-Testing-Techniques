### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * t1 # Square the output of the convolution
t4 = t3 * t1 # Cube the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 * 0.044715 # Multiply the cube of the output of the convolution by 0.044715
t6 = t1 + t5 # Add the output of the convolution to the result of the previous operation
t7 = t6 * 0.7978845608028654 # Multiply the result of the previous operation by 0.7978845608028654
t8 = torch.tanh(t7) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the result of the previous operation
t9 = t8 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
t10 = t2 * t9 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is squared, cubed, and then multiplied by a constant `0.044715`, and then the output of the convolution is added to the result of the previous operation, and then the result of the previous operation is multiplied by another constant `0.7978845608028654`, and then the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to the result of the previous operation, and then `1` is added to the output of the hyperbolic tangent function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the hyperbolic tangent function.
