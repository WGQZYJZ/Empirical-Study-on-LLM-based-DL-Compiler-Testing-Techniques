### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.sigmoid(t1) # Apply the sigmoid function to the output of the convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is passed through a sigmoid activation function. This is a common pattern in neural networks where the sigmoid function is used to squash the output of the convolution between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.
