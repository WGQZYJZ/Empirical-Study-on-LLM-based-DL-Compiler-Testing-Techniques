### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
split_tensors = torch.split(input_tensor, split_sizes, dim) # Split the input tensor into several tensors along a given dimension
concatenated_tensor = torch.cat([split_tensors[i] for i in range(len(split_sizes))], dim) # Concatenate the split tensors along the same dimension
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where an input tensor is split into several tensors along a given dimension using `torch.split`, and then these split tensors are concatenated along the same dimension using `torch.cat`.

The `return True` line within the `is_valid_splitwithsizes_cat` optimization can be triggered if the following conditions are met:
1. There is only one `torch.split` operation and one `torch.cat` operation in the model.
2. The dimension along which the split and concatenation operations are performed is the same.
3. All split tensors are used in the concatenation operation.
4. The order of the split tensors in the concatenation operation is the same as their original order in the split operation.
