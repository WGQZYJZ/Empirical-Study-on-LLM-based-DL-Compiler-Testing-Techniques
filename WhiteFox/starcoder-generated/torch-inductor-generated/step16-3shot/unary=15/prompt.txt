### Please generate different valid PyTorch models with public PyTorch APIs that meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. Be creative when generating new models to explore different possibilities that trigger the pattern. Feel free to leverage various PyTorch APIs, uncommon arguments, and input tensors with different shapes and data types.

# Description of requirements:
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = relu(t1) # Apply the ReLU activation function to the output of the convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise convolution is applied to an input tensor, and then the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied to the output of the convolution. This is a common pattern in convolutional neural networks, where the ReLU function is used to introduce non-linearity after each convolution operation.
