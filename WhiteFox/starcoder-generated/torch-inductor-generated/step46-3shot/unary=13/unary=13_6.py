In the cell, please provide code that implements the gating mechanism model (the model described above) using either `torch.nn.Linear` layers, or `torch.matmul()` operations, but not a combination of them.

from torch.nn import Linear, Sigmoid, Module, ModuleList

class Model(Module):
    def __init__(self, nin, nout):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = Linear(nin, nout)
        self.sigmoid = Sigmoid()
    def forward(self, x):
        t1 = self.linear(x)
        t2 = sigmoid(t1)
#        t3 = t1 * t2
        return t2


# Initializing an instance of the model
# The model should take as its inputs a single tensor with the input to the gating mechanism. It should output a single tensor that contains the output of the gating mechanism.

m = Model(8, 8)

x = torch.rand(1, 8)
output = m(x) # Output of the gating mechanism
