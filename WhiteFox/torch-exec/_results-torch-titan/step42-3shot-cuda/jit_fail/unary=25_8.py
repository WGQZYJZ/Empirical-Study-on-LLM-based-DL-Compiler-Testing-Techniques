direct:
Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu! (when checking argument for argument mat2 in method wrapper_CUDA_mm)

jit:
Failed running call_function <built-in function linear>(*(FakeTensor(..., device='cuda:0', size=(1, 3, 64, 64)),), **{'weight': FakeTensor(..., size=(3, 3))}):
a and b must have same reduction dim, but got [192, 64] X [3, 3].

You can suppress this exception and fall back to eager by setting:
    import torch._dynamo
    torch._dynamo.config.suppress_errors = True
